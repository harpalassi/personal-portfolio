# Personal Portfolio ðŸ–¼

## Description

My current portfolio that I built with React and CSS Flexbox showcasing projects I've worked on myself and with groups of developers.

## Motivation

I wanted to build a portfolio that was minimal, responsive, and accessible, yet showcase my abilities to the fullest extent. One of the biggest challenges was creating a design from scratch.

## Tools

I chose to use React for the front-end so I could map through my components and display them dynamically as well as wanting to take an overall deeper dive into the library. I incorporated lazy-loading components with `Suspense` and `React.lazy()`. I also utilized React Hooks over class-based components as I prefer the syntax.
