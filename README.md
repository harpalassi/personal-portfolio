# Portfolio 2019 ðŸ–Œ

My current portfolio that I built with React and CSS Flexbox showcasing projects I've worked on myself and with groups of developers.

A big challenge was coming up with a design from scratch. I wanted it to be minimal, responsive, and accessible, yet showcase my abilities to the fullest extent.

I chose to use React for the front-end so I could map through my projects and display them dynamically as well as wanting to take an overall deeper dive into the library. I incorporated lazy-loading components with `Suspense` and `React.lazy()`.
